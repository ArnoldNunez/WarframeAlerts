# Warframe Alerts

Application that will show Warframe in game information such as alerts, invasions, events etc...

This is a react web application that will display in game information to users in a beautiful way. This project will focus mainly on front-end processing of the Warframe worldstate API and display the data in a readable and beautiful manner. The plan is for there to be minimal to no backend application as all data processing will be done in the front-end. However, the application should be built in such a way so that integration with a backend should require minimal work.
